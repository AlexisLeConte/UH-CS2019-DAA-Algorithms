# DAA - Design and Analysis of Algorithms

This repository contains some algorithms I have implemented as part of the DAA course I am pursuing at the University of Helsinki (Autumn 2019).

## Week 1 Implementation Exercises

- Quicksort with random pivot
- Quicksort with perfect pivot
- Bruteforce matrix multiplication

## Week 2 Implementation Exercices

- Divide and Conquer matrix multiplication
- Board tiling
- K-way merge

## Week 3 Implementation Exercices

- Reverse engineering: Finding the minimum for all subarrays in O(n*log(n)) time
- Optimal order to multiply matrices
- DAG topological sorting
